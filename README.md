# :wave: Hey! I'm techy!
> I'm a nerd that likes software, web, and game development! I can code in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and a little of JS. I'm still new to HTML and CSS so some of my code is a little messy, but over time it will get better and better. I'm also in the process of trying to learn C# and C++ for game development. I also own the [@TechCraftMC](https://github.com/TechCraftMC) Minecraft multiplayer network which I code plugins in Java for.

### I can code:
